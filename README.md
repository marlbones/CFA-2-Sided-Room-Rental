AirTnT
===================

### Introduction

This was an in-class Coder Factory Academy project built using Ruby on Rails and is designed to be an imitation of Airbnb. The project was primarily centred around solidifying understanding of the MVC model and route relationships, and introducing image uploads through carrier-wave gem plus payments through stripe.

### Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/marlbones/CFA-2-Sided-Room-Rental.git
```

```
$ cd airtnt
```

```
$ bundle
```

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

### Design
Minimal design was made within this project as the primary focus was about back-end relationships. I used bootstrap to make the appearance cleaner/easier on the eye.

### Build
Primary learnings: Made multiple uploads available through carrier-wave gem and added stripe payments/configurations. Nested charges within bookings method and developed further understanding of route navigation.
